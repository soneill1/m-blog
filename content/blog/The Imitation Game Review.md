# A hero of WWII and modern computing that you may not have heard of!

I just watched this recently having discovered it on Netflix in the Critically acclaimed movies section (Awesome category BTW!) and it held my attention all the way through. 

This movie tells the real life story of Alan Turing, who used his creativity and brilliance to construct one of the earliest computers durring WWII for the purpose of cracking NAZI encrypted codes. Turings work helped the Allied forces win many decisive battles in WWII, and experts beleive helped end the war early. He is also credited for builidng the first modern computer, which helped revolutionize what we have present day.

So that's the BIO about Turing, the awesome Computer Scientist that he is! Now back to the movie.....
This was a quality picture, and you really felt the attention to detail of the period in every scene. Benedict Cumbersquatch acting was execellent. He made you forget about any other picture he done previously, and expressed himself truley as turing, an awkward, anti social, but sweet person deep down. 

Some of my favorite Alan Turing quotes from the movie were:

##### "Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine."

##### "Do you know why people like violence? It is because it feels good. Humans find violence deeply satisfying. but remove the satisfaction, and the act becomes... hollow."

##### "Machines can never think as humans do but just because something thinks differently from you, does it mean it's not thinking?"

I won't spoil the ending, but it is certainly tragic and not the ending anyone would hope for. I hope that you get a chance to check out this movie based on real events. It is truley amazing what Alan Turing did not only for the War, but also for modern day computing. He is one of the greatest mind's in history, and if you watch his movie I hope that it may grip, and inspire you to think outside the bounds of your normal creativity and do something great as well. 

As always thank you for reading!!!
